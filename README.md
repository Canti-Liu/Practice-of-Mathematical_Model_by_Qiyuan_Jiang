# Practice-of-Mathematical_Model_by_Qiyuan_Jiang
 In the process of learning Matlab, I found that many of the easy methods in Matlab are more complicated to write in other languages, so I will try to rewrite some .m files in Jiang's "Mathematical Model" into .py files, that is, as a python exercise, by the way, review the algorithm to deepen the impression.
